#   Source: problem from Kortanek and No
#   The problem is really a semi-infinite QP
#   to appear in SIAM J. Optimization.

#   The structure is the following :


#     min  "Sum"{ Xj^2/(2j) + Xj/j  ;  j=1,...,n }   subject to

#      "Sum"{ t^(j-1)#Xj } ; j=1,...,n  >=  b(t) for all t in [0 1].


# Four examples are considered for n = 20, corresponding to the RHS
# function, b(t) : sin(t), 1/(2-t), exp(t), and tan(t).

# The interval [0 1] is dicretized via steps of 1/1000

#   SIF input: A.R. Conn, May 1993
